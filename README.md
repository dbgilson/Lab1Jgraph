# Lab1Jgraph

The point of this lab was to make something fun or interesting using the jgraph modeler.  I decided to make a fun little game of "Test Your Might" where you try to press the space button as many times as you can for 5 seconds.  The program then generates a fun little visual similar to the strength games at carnivals.  While it isn't too complex, I had fun making it and learned how to make a unique graphic with the jgraph program.
